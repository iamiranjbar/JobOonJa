This project is the Internet engineering course project at the University of Tehran.

We implemented a complete platform for projects outsourcing. The backend of this project was implemented in Java. The frontend was developed by React framework.

This repository contains the backend side code. In this project, we learned to develop a website step by step. Steps come from how the internet grows and new technologies come in time.
